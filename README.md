# Counterfactual Explanations for Credit Risk Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a **Counterfactual Explanation** system from scratch, applied to a **credit risk prediction** model (e.g., loan approval vs. rejection). Counterfactual explanations provide insights into how a model’s outcome can be changed by making minimal, plausible adjustments to input features. In the context of finance and credit scoring, these explanations help both lenders and applicants understand what factors are driving decisions, and how an applicant might improve their likelihood of approval.

### Key Features
- **Neural Network Model**: A feedforward neural network (or your chosen ML model) trained to classify loan applications as “approve” or “reject.”
- **From-Scratch Counterfactuals**: An implementation of a gradient-based or search-based algorithm (or both) for generating instance-level explanations about how to flip the model’s decision.
- **Actionability Constraints**: Logic and constraints to ensure suggestions are realistic (e.g., not changing immutable attributes such as gender or significantly beyond typical income ranges).
- **Visualization**: Scripts and notebooks that produce user-friendly, before-and-after comparisons of counterfactuals, highlighting which features need to be changed.
